# H960 Cabinet

Both H960 cabinets are in good shape, but need to be cleaned.

The back panel on both cabinets have been slightly bent and should to be straightened out.

Side panels are missing (at least one panel still existed while in storage at Evry). Replacement panels will probably be hard to find.

The cabinet fans may not be critical for (our) operation, but should nevertheless be serviced and tested.
